## Description

Your Movie Database is a movie application that will present the user with related links on Youtube based on their searches. The user will search by movie name and then they will be presented with results based on that movie title. The user can also make their selections a favorite, allowing them to have that info saved to their dashboard, so they can always come back and check it out.
